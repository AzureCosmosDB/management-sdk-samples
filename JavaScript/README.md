# Azure Management JavaScript/TypeScript SDK Samples for Azure Cosmos DB

This folder is a placeholder for a JavaScript/TypeScript sample that will use the **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) / Management Plane** SDKs to create and update **Azure Cosmos DB** resources.

## Status

Not yet available.

## Planned scope (high level)

When implemented, this sample is expected to demonstrate management-plane operations similar to the other languages in this repo (account/database/container/throughput/RBAC).

## Running

TBD once the sample is added.
